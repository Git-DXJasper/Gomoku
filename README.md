#Gomoku AI Project:  

##Main program and using:


* The name of the main program is wuziqi.py, and running this program can display the Gomoku game interface.  

* When you enter game interface, the default mode is man to man play, so if you want to play with AI, you can select ModeSelect, and then choose ‘Computer plays black’ or ‘Computer plays white’.  

* If you want to start a new game, you ought to run again our program. (That will be improved in next time,we will add a restart button to undo all current moves and start a new game).
